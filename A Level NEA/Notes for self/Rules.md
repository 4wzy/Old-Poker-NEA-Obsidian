Texas Hold'em Poker is one of the most popular poker variations.

1. At the start of the game, each player is dealt 2 cards face down (known as the hole cards), and there are 3 cards on the table face up for every player to see (called community cards)
- The first 3 community cards are called "The Flop".
- The 4th community card is called "The Turn"
- The 5th community card is called "The River"
1. There are several betting rounds
2. When a cash total is agreed at the end of each betting round, another card will be revealed until there are 5 cards on the table that everyone can see
3. After the last betting round, each player needs to make the best five-card poker hand using the best avilable five cards out of the total 7 - your 2 hole cards, and the 5 community cards.
4. If the betting causes everyone to fold apart from one remaining player, they will win the pot (the total money bet in the middle), and they do not have to show their cards.
5. The highest poker hand wins.

## How to play

- The play moves clockwise around the table, starting with action to the left of the dealer.
- The first two players sitting to the left of the dealer are required to post a "small blind" and a "big bling" to initiate the betting. 
- The first player to act is the player to the left of the big blind
- The first player has the following options:
	- Call - match the amount of the big blind
	- Raise - increase the bet within the specific limits of the game
	- Fold - throw the hand away, and be out of the game for the current round
