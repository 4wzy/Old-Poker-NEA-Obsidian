I could also implement "bullshit", the card game that we play at school as a side-game or something. This could be good as it is more mathematical instead of just bluffing, as the AI could keep track of how many of which types of cards have already been placed down.

### Way to implement this
The project could be similar to GOP 2, where there is a map of places to travel. This way, the user can login and logout using different accounts, with account information encrypted and stored in external files. The kind of information I am talking about is: username, password, player balance, player progress. 

The user may have to travel to play different minigames such as Poker or "Bullshit" or BlackJack. Ideally, every game would be a card game.

This website could be used to actually create my own poker table and to create chips, perhaps dynamically allocating chips on the UI for each player?
