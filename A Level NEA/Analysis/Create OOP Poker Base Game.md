### Classes I will start off with

1.  Card Class: This class represents a single card in the game. It should contain information about the suit and rank of the card.
    
2.  Deck Class: This class represents a deck of 52 cards. It should contain methods for shuffling the deck and dealing cards.
    
3.  Player Class: This class represents a single player in the game. It should contain information about the player's name, chips, and current hand of cards.
    
4.  Game Class: This class represents the game itself. It should contain methods for managing the game flow, such as dealing cards, managing bets, and determining winners.
    
5.  Hand Class: This class represents a hand of cards. It should contain information about the cards in the hand and methods for evaluating the strength of the hand.
    
6.  Pot Class: This class represents the pot of chips in the game. It should contain methods for adding and subtracting chips from the pot, and for determining the current size of the pot.



## More advanced use of OOP

## IMPORTANT:
I could add a unique feature where there are different kinds of players with different kinds of classes, similar to how there is a spy in Goose Goose Duck or a muter (I forgot the name of the roles). These would inherit from the Player class but have their own methods as well.

1.  Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. In the context of a poker game, you might use inheritance to create different types of players that have unique abilities or traits.

For example, you could create a subclass of the Player class called AIPlayer that has additional methods and attributes for managing the AI player's behavior and decision-making process.

2.  Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows you to use the same interface to represent different types of objects. In the context of a poker game, you might use polymorphism to create different types of hands that can be evaluated using the same method.

For example, you could create a subclass of the Hand class called FlushHand that overrides the evaluate() method to implement a custom evaluation logic for a flush hand. Then, you can use the same evaluate() method for all types of hands, and the correct evaluation logic will be automatically selected based on the type of hand.

Here's an example of how you might use inheritance and polymorphism in your Texas Hold'em Poker game:
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, chips):
        self.name = name
        self.chips = chips
        self.hand = []

    def receive_card(self, card):
        self.hand.append(card)

class AIPlayer(Player):
    def __init__(self, name, chips, strategy):
        super().__init__(name, chips)
        self.strategy = strategy

    def make_decision(self):
        return self.strategy.make_decision(self.hand)

class Hand:
    def __init__(self, cards):
        self.cards = cards

    def evaluate(self):
        if self.is_flush():
            return "Flush"
        elif self.is_straight():
            return "Straight"
        else:
            return "High Card"

    def is_flush(self):
        pass

    def is_straight(self):
        pass

class FlushHand(Hand):
    def evaluate(self):
        return "Flush"

```
In this example, we have created a new subclass of the Player class called AIPlayer that has an additional attribute called "strategy" and a new method called "make_decision()". We have also created a new subclass of the Hand class called FlushHand that overrides the evaluate() method to return the string "Flush".

By using inheritance and polymorphism, you can create a more flexible and extensible codebase for your Texas Hold'em Poker game.
